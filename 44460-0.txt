               CARLETON'S CONDENSED CLASSICAL DICTIONARY.


=Aby´dos.= A city of Asia opposite Sestos in Europe. It is famous for the
loves of Hero and Leander, and for the bridge of boats which Xerxes
built there across the Hellespont. Leander was in the habit of swimming
across the Hellespont to see Hero, till at length, on a stormy night, he
was drowned.

=Aby´dos.= A town of Egypt, where was the famous temple of Osiris.

=Acade´mi´a.= A place surrounded with trees, near Athens, belonging to
Academus, from whom the name is derived. Here Plato opened his school of
philosophy, and from this every place sacred to learning has ever since
been called Academia.

=Acha´tes.= A friend of Æneas, whose fidelity was so exemplary that _Fidus
Achates_ has become a proverb.

=Achelo´us.= The son of Oceanus and Terra, or Tethys, god of the river of
the same name in Epirus. As one of the numerous suitors of Dejanira, he
entered the lists against Hercules, and being inferior, changed himself
into a serpent, and afterwards into an ox. Hercules broke off one of his
horns and defeated him, after which, according to some, he was changed
into a river.

=Ac´heron.= One of the rivers of hell; often used to signify hell itself.

=Achil´les=, the son of Peleus and Thetis, was the bravest of all the
Greeks in the Trojan war. During his infancy, Thetis plunged him in the
Styx, thus making every part of his body invulnerable except the heel by
which she held him. To prevent him from going to the Trojan war, Thetis
sent him privately to the court of Lycomedes, where he was disguised in
a female dress. As Troy could not be taken without his aid, Ulysses went
to the court of Lycomedes in the habit of a merchant, and exposed jewels
and arms for sale. Achilles, choosing the arms, discovered his sex, and
went to the war. Vulcan made him a strong suit of armor, which was proof
against all weapons. He was deprived by Agamemnon of his favorite
Briseis, and for this affront he would not appear on the field till the
death of Patroclus impelled him to vengeance. He slew Hector, who had
killed Patroclus, and tying his corpse to his war-car, dragged it three
times round Troy. He is said to have been killed by Paris, who inflicted
a mortal wound in his vulnerable heel with an arrow.

=A´cis.= A shepherd of Sicily, son of Faunus and the nymph Simæthis.
Galatea passionately loved him, upon which his rival, Polyphemus,
crushed him to death with a piece of broken rock. The gods changed Acis
into a stream, which rises from Mount Etna.

=Actæ´on.= A famous huntsman, son of Aristæus and Autonoe, daughter of
Cadmus. He saw Diana and her attendants bathing, for which he was
changed into a stag and devoured by his own dogs.

=Ac´tium.= A town and promontory of Epirus, famous for the naval victory
which Augustus obtained over Antony and Cleopatra, B. C. 31.

=A´des or Hades.= The God of hell amongst the Greeks; the same as the
Pluto of the Latins. The word is often used for hell itself by the
ancient poets.

=Adher´bal.= Son of Micipsa, and grandson of Masinissa, was besieged at
Cirta, and put to death by Jugurtha, after vainly imploring the aid of
Rome, B. C. 112.

=Adme´tus.= Son of Pheres and Clymene, king of Pheræ in Thessaly. Apollo,
when banished from heaven, is said to have tended his flocks for nine
years.

=Ado´nis=, son of Cinyras and Myrrha, was the favorite of Venus. He was
fond of hunting, and was often cautioned not to hunt wild beasts. This
advice he slighted, and at last was mortally wounded by a wild boar.
Venus changed him into the flower anemone. Proserpine is said to have
restored him to life, on condition that he should spend six months of
the year with her, and the rest of the year with Venus. This implies the
alternate return of summer and winter.

=Adras´tus=, son of Talaus and Lysimache, was king of Argos. Polynices,
being banished from Thebes by his brother Eteocles, fled to Argos, where
he married Argia, daughter of Adrastus. The king assisted his
son-in-law, and marched against Thebes with an army. He was defeated
with great slaughter, and fled to Athens, where Theseus gave him
assistance, and was victorious. Adrastus died from grief, occasioned by
the death of his son Ægialeus.

=Adria´nus.= A famous emperor of Rome. He is represented as an active,
learned, warlike, and austere general. He came to Britain, where he
built a wall between the modern towns of Carlisle and Newcastle-on-Tyne,
to protect the Britons from the incursions of the Caledonians.

=Ædi´les.= Roman magistrates, who had the charge of all buildings, baths,
and aqueducts, and examined weights and measures. The office of an Ædile
was honorable, and the primary step to a more distinguished position in
the State.

=Ægeus.= King of Athens, son of Pandion. Being desirous of having
children, he went to consult the oracle, and on his return stopped at
the court of Pittheus, king of Troezene, who gave him his daughter
Æthra in marriage. He directed her, if she had a son, to send him to
Athens as soon as he could lift a stone under which he had concealed his
sword. Æthra became mother of Theseus, whom she sent to Athens with his
father's sword, Ægeus being at that time living with Medea, the divorced
wife of Jason. When Theseus came to Athens, Medea attempted to poison
him, but he escaped; and upon showing Ægeus the sword, discovered
himself to be his son. When Theseus returned from Crete, after the death
of the Minotaur, he omitted to hoist up white sails, as a signal of
success, and at sight of black sails, Ægeus, concluding that his son was
dead, threw himself into the sea, which, as some suppose, has since been
called the Ægean sea. Ægeus died B. C. 1235.

=Ægis.= The shield of Jupiter. He gave it to Pallas, who placed Medusa's
head on it, which turned into stones all those who gazed at it.

=Ægy´ptus=, son of Belus, and brother to Danaus, gave his fifty sons in
marriage to the fifty daughters of his brother. Danaus, who had
established himself at Argos, and was jealous of his brother, obliged
all his daughters to murder their husbands on the first night of their
nuptials. This was done, Hypermnestra alone sparing her husband Lynceus.
Ægyptus himself was killed by his niece Polyxena.

=Ælia´nus Clau´dius.= A Roman sophist of Præneste in the reign of Adrian.
He taught rhetoric at Rome. He wrote treatises on animals in seventeen
books, and on various other subjects in fourteen books. Ælian died at
the age of sixty, A. D. 140.

=Æne´as.= A Trojan prince, son of Anchises and Venus. He married Creusa,
the daughter of Priam, and they had a son named Ascanius. During the
Trojan war Æneas behaved with great valor in defense of Troy. When the
city was in flames he is said to have carried away his father Anchises
on his shoulders, leading his son Ascanius by the hand, his wife
following them. Subsequently he built a fleet of twenty ships, with
which he set sail in quest of a settlement. He was driven on the coasts
of Africa, and was kindly received by Dido, Queen of Carthage, who
became enamored with him; but he left Carthage by the order of the gods.
He has been praised for his piety and his submission to the will of the
gods; the term "Pius" is generally appended to his name.

=Æne´is.= The Æneid, a grand poem by Virgil, the great merit of which is
well known. The author has imitated the style of Homer, and is by some
thought to equal him.

=Æolus=, the ruler of storms and winds, was the son of Hippotas. He
reigned over Æolia. He was the inventor of sails, and a great
astronomer, from which the poets have called him the god of wind.

=Æs´chines.= An Athenian orator who lived about 342 B.C.; and
distinguished himself by his rivalship with Demosthenes.

=Æs´chylus=, a soldier and poet of Athens, son of Euphorion. He was in the
Athenian army at the battles of Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa; but his
most solid fame rests on his writings. He wrote ninety tragedies, forty
of which were rewarded with a public prize. He was killed by the fall of
a tortoise, dropped from the beak of an eagle on his head, B.C. 456.

=Æscula´pius=, son of Apollo and Coronis, or, as some say, of Apollo and
Larissa, daughter of Phlegias, was the god of medicine. He married
Epione, and they had two sons, famous for their skill in medicine,
Machaon and Podalirus; of their four daughters, Hygeia, goddess of
health, is the most celebrated.

=Æson=, son of Cretheus, was born at the same birth as Pelias. He
succeeded his father in the kingdom of Iolchos, but was soon exiled by
his brother. He married Alcimeda, by whom he had Jason, whose education
he intrusted to Chiron. When Jason reached manhood he demanded his
father's kingdom from his uncle, who gave him evasive answers, and
persuaded him to go in quest of the Golden Fleece. On his return Jason
found his father very infirm, and at his request Medea drew the blood
from Æson's veins and refilled them with the juice of certain herbs,
which restored the old man to the vigor of youth.

=Æso´pus.= A Phrygian philosopher who, originally a slave, procured his
liberty by his genius. He dedicated his fables to his patron Croesus.
The fables which we have now under his name doubtless are a collection
of fables and apologues of wits before and after the age of Æsop,
conjointly with his own.

=Agamem´non=, king of Mycenæ and Argos, was brother to Menelaus, and son
of Plisthenes, the son of Atreus. He married Clytemnestra, and Menelaus
Helen, both daughters of Tyndarus, king of Sparta. When Helen eloped
with Paris, Agamemnon was elected commander-in-chief of the Grecian
forces invading Troy.

=Agesila´us.= Of the family of the Proclidæ, son of Archidamus, king of
Sparta, whom he succeeded. He made war against Artaxerxes, king of
Persia, with success; but in the midst of his conquests he was called
home to oppose the Athenians and Boetians. He passed over in thirty
days that tract of country which had taken up a whole year of Xerxes'
expedition. He defeated his enemies at Coronea, but sickness interfered
with his conquests, and the Spartans were beaten in every engagement
till he again appeared at their head. He died 362 years B.C.

=Agrip´pa, M. Vipsanius.= A celebrated Roman who obtained a victory over
S. Pompey, and favored the cause of Augustus at the battles of Actium
and Philippi, where he behaved with great valor. In his expeditions in
Gaul and Germany he obtained several victories, but refused the honor of
a triumph, and turned his attention to the embellishment of Rome and the
raising of magnificent buildings, among them the Pantheon. Augustus
gave him his daughter Julia in marriage. He died universally lamented at
Rome, aged fifty-one, B.C. 12.

=Agrip´pa.= A son of Aristobulus, grandson of the great Herod. He was
popular with the Jews, and it is said that while they were flattering
him with the appellation of god he was struck with death, A.D. 43. His
son of the same name was with Titus at the siege of Jerusalem, and died
A.D. 94. It was before him that St. Paul pleaded. There were a number of
others of the same name, but of less celebrity.

=A´jax=, son of Telamon and Periboea, or Eriboea, was one of the
bravest of the Greeks in the Trojan war. After the death of Achilles,
Ajax and Ulysses both claimed the arms of the dead hero, which were
given to Ulysses. Some say that he was killed in battle by Paris, but
others record that he was murdered by Ulysses.

=Alari´cus.= A famous king of the Goths, who plundered Rome in the reign
of Honorius. He was greatly respected for his valor, and during his
reign he kept the Roman empire in continual alarm. He died after a reign
of twelve years, A.D. 410. He was buried in the bed of a river which had
been turned from its course for the reception of his corpse, in order
that it might be said that no one should tread on the earth where he
reposed.

=Al´bion=, son of Neptune and Amphitrite, came into Britain, where he
established a kingdom, and introduced astrology and the art of building
ships. Great Britain is called "Albion" after him.

=Alcæ´us.= A celebrated lyric poet of Mitylene, in Lesbos, about 600 years
before the Christian era. He fled from a battle, and the armor in which
he left the field was hung up in the temple of Minerva as a monument of
his disgrace. He was enamored of Sappho. Of his works only a few
fragments remain.

=Alces´te= or =Alces´tis=, daughter of Pelias, married Admetus. She, with
her sisters, put her father to death that he might be restored to youth
and vigor by Medea, who had promised to effect this by her enchantments.
She, however, refused to fulfill her promise, on which the sisters fled
to Admetus, who married Alceste.

=Alcibi´ades.= An Athenian general, famous for his enterprise, versatile
genius, and natural foibles. He was a disciple of Socrates, whose
lessons and example checked for a while his vicious propensities. In the
Peloponnesian war he encouraged the Athenians to undertake an expedition
against Syracuse. He died in his forty-sixth year, B.C. 404.

=Alcme´na.= Daughter of Electrion, king of Argos. Her father promised her
and his crown to Amphitryon if he would revenge the death of his sons,
who had been killed by the Teleboans. In the absence of Amphitryon,
Jupiter assumed his form and visited Alcmena, who, believing the god to
be her lover, received him with joy. Amphitryon, on his return,
ascertained from the prophet Tiresias the deception which had been
practiced. After the death of Amphitryon Alcmena married Rhadamanthus.
Hercules was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena.

=Alcy´one= or =Halcy´one=, daughter of Æolus, married Ceyx, who was drowned
as he was going to consult the oracle. The gods apprised Alcyone in a
dream of her husband's fate, and when she found his body washed ashore
she threw herself into the sea, and she and her husband were changed
into birds.

=Alec´to.= One of the Furies. She is represented with her head covered
with serpents, and breathing vengeance, war, and pestilence.

=Alexan´der=, surnamed the Great, was son of Philip and Olympias. He was
born B. C. 355, on the night on which the famous temple of Diana at
Ephesus was burnt. This event, according to the magicians, was a
prognostic of his future greatness, as well as the taming of Bucephalus,
a horse which none of the king's attendants could manage. Philip, it is
recorded, said, with tears in his eyes, that his son must seek another
kingdom, as that of Macedonia would not be large enough for him. He
built a town, which he called Alexandria, on the Nile. His conquests
were extended to India, where he fought with Porus, a powerful king of
the country, and after he had invaded Scythia, he retired to Babylon
laden with spoils. His entry into the city was predicted by the
magicians as to prove fatal to him. He died at Babylon in his
thirty-second year, after a reign of twelve years and eight months of
continual success, B. C. 323. There were a number of others of the same
name, but of less celebrity.

=Althæ´a=, daughter of Thestius and Eurythemis, married OEneus, king of
Calydon, by whom she had many children, amongst them being Meleager.
When he was born the Parcæ put a log of wood on the fire, saying, as
long as it was preserved the life of the child would be prolonged. The
mother took the wood from the flames and preserved it, but when Meleager
killed his two uncles, Althæa, to revenge them, threw the log in the
fire, and when it was burnt Meleager expired. Althæa then killed
herself.

=Amaryl´lis.= The name of a countrywoman in Virgil's Eclogues. Some
commentators have supposed that the poet spoke of Rome under this
fictitious name.

=Amaz´ones or Amazonides.= A nation of famous women who lived near the
river Thermodon in Cappadocia. All their lives were employed in wars and
manly exercises. They founded an extensive empire in Asia Minor along
the shores of the Euxine.

=Ambra´cia.= A city of Epirus, the residence of King Pyrrhus. Augustus,
after the battle of Actium, called it Nicopolis.

=Amphiara´us=, son of Oicleus and Hypermnestra, was at the chase of the
Calydonian boar, and accompanied the Argonauts in their expedition. He
was famous for his knowledge of futurity.

=Amphic´tyon=, son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, reigned at Athens after
Cranaus. Some say the deluge happened in his age.

=Amphic´tyon=, the son of Helenus, who first established the celebrated
Council of the Amphictyons, composed of the wisest and most virtuous men
of some cities of Greece.

=Amphi´on=, son of Jupiter and Antiope. He cultivated poetry, and made
such progress in music that he is said to have been the inventor of it,
and to have built the walls of Thebes by the sound of his lyre.

=Amphitri´te.= A daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, who married Neptune. She
is sometimes called Salatia. She was mother of Triton, a sea deity.

=Amphit´ryon.= A Theban prince, son of Alcæus and Hipponome. His sister
Anaxo married Electryon, king of Mycenæ, whose sons were killed in
battle by the Teleboans. Electryon gave his daughter Alcmena to
Amphitryon for avenging the death of his sons.

=Anachar´sis=, a Scythian philosopher 592 years B. C., who, on account of
his wisdom, temperance, and knowledge, has been called one of the seven
wise men. He has rendered himself famous among the Ancients by his
writings, his poems on war, the laws of the Scythians, etc.

=Anac´reon.= A famous lyric poet of Teos, in Ionia, favored by Polycrates
and Hipparchus, son of Philostratus. He was of intemperate habits and
fond of pleasure. Some of his odes are extant, and the elegance of his
poetry has been the admiration of every age and country. He lived to the
age of eighty-five, and after a life of voluptuousness was choked with a
grape stone. He flourished B. C. 532.

=Anadyom´ene.= A famous painting by Apelles of Venus rising from the sea.

=Anaxag´oras.= A Clazomenian philosopher, who disregarded wealth and
honors to indulge his fondness for meditation and philosophy. He applied
himself to astronomy, and obtained a knowledge of eclipses. He used to
say he preferred a grain of wisdom to heaps of gold. He was accused of
impiety and condemned to die, but he ridiculed the sentence, which he
said had already been pronounced on him by nature. He died at the age of
seventy-two, B. C. 428.

=Anaxar´ete.= A girl of Salamis, who so arrogantly rejected the addresses
of Iphis, a youth of ignoble birth, that he hanged himself at her door.
She saw the spectacle without emotion, and was changed into stone.

=Anchi´ses.= A son of Capys and Themis. He was so beautiful that Venus
came down from heaven on Mount Ida to enjoy his company. Æneas was the
son of Anchises and Venus, and was intrusted to the care of Chiron the
Centaur. When Troy was taken, Anchises had become so infirm that Æneas
had to carry him through the flames upon his shoulders, and thus saved
his life.

=Androm´ache.= Daughter of Eetion, king of Thebes. She married Hector, son
of Priam, and was the mother of Astyanax. Her parting with Hector, who
was going to battle, is described in the Iliad, and has been deemed one
of the most beautiful passages in that great work. Pope's translation of
the Iliad (book 6) describes with great pathos and beauty the parting of
Hector from his wife and child.

=Androm´eda.= A daughter of Cepheus, king of Æthiopia, and Cassiope. She
was promised in marriage to Phineus when Neptune drowned the kingdom and
sent a sea monster to ravage the country, because Cassiope had boasted
that she was fairer than Juno and the Nereides. The oracle of Jupiter
Ammon was consulted, but nothing could stop the resentment of Neptune
except the exposure of Andromeda to the sea monster. She was accordingly
tied to a rock, but at the moment that the monster was about to devour
her, Perseus, returning from the conquest of the Gorgons, saw her, and
was captivated with her beauty. He changed the monster into a rock by
showing Medusa's head, and released Andromeda and married her.

=Anthropoph´agi.= A people of Scythia who fed on human flesh. They lived
near the country of the Messagetæ. Shakspeare makes Othello, in his
speech to the Senate, allude to the Anthropophagi thus:--

    "The cannibals that each other eat,
     The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
     Do grow beneath their shoulders."

=Antig´one.= A daughter of OEdipus, king of Thebes. She buried by night
her brother Polynices, against the orders of Creon, who ordered her to
be buried alive. She, however, killed herself on hearing of the
sentence. The death of Antigone is the subject of one of the finest
tragedies of Sophocles. The play has been adapted for representation on
the English stage, Miss Helen Faucit performing the heroine with
exquisite pathos.

=Antig´onus.= One of Alexander's generals, who, on the division of the
provinces after the king's death, received Pamphylia, Lycia, and
Phrygia. Eventually his power became so great that Ptolemy, Seleucus,
Cassander, and Lysimachus combined to destroy him. He gained many
victories over them, but at last was killed in battle at the age of
eighty, B.C. 301. There were others of the same name, but much less
conspicuous.

=Antin´ous.= A youth of Bithynia of whom the emperor Adrian was so
extremely fond that, at his death, he erected a temple to him, and
wished it to be believed that he had been changed into a constellation.

=Anti´ochus=, surnamed _Soter_, was son of Seleucus and king of Syria. He
made a treaty of alliance with Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt. He
wedded his step-mother Stratonice. He was succeeded by his son Antiochus
II., who put an end to the war which had begun with Ptolemy, and married
his daughter Berenice, but being already married to Laodice, she, in
revenge, poisoned him. Antiochus, the third of that name, surnamed the
Great, was king of Syria, and reigned thirty-six years. He was defeated
by Ptolemy Philopater at Raphia. He conquered the greater part of
Greece, and Hannibal incited him to enter on a crusade against Roma. He
was killed 187 years before the Christian era. Antiochus Epiphanes, the
fourth of the name, was king of Syria after his brother Seleucus. He
behaved with cruelty to the Jews. He reigned eleven years, and died
unregretted. There were many others of the same name of less note.

=Ant´iope=, daughter of Nycteus, king of Thebes, and Polyxo, was beloved
by Jupiter. Amphion and Tethus were her offspring.

=Antip´ater=, son of Iolaus, was a soldier under King Philip, and raised
to the rank of a general under Alexander the Great. When Alexander went
to invade Asia, he left Antipater supreme governor of Macedonia. He has
been suspected of giving poison to Alexander to advance himself in
power.

=Antoni´nus=, surnamed _Pius_, was adopted by the Emperor Adrian, whom he
succeeded. He was remarkable for all the virtues forming a perfect
statesman, philosopher, and king. He treated his subjects with
affability and humanity, and listened with patience to every complaint
brought before him. He died in his seventy-fifth year, after a reign of
twenty-three years, A.D. 160.

=Anto´nius Mar´cus.= Mark Antony, the triumvir, distinguished himself by
his ambitious views. When Julius Cæsar was killed in the senate house,
Antony delivered an oration over his body, the eloquence of which is
recorded in Shakspeare's tragedy of Julius Cæsar. Antony had married
Fulvia, whom he repudiated to marry Octavia, the sister of Augustus. He
fought by the side of Augustus at the battle of Philippi, against the
murderers of Julius Cæsar. Subsequently he became enamored with
Cleopatra, the renowned queen of Egypt, and repudiated Octavia to marry
her. He was utterly defeated at the battle of Actium, and stabbed
himself. He died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, B.C. 30.

=Anto´nius, Ju´lius=, son of the famous triumvir Antony, by Fulvia, was
consul with Paulus Fabius Maximus. He was surnamed Africanus, and put to
death by order of Augustus, but some say he killed himself.

=Anto´nius M. Gni´pho.= A poet of Gaul who taught rhetoric at Rome. Cicero
and other illustrious men frequented his school. There were a number of
others of the same name, but of less repute.

=Apel´les.= A celebrated painter of Cos, or, as others say, of Ephesus,
son of Pithius. He lived in the age of Alexander the Great, who forbade
any one but Apelles to paint his portrait. He was so absorbed in his
profession that he never allowed a day to pass without employing himself
at his art: hence the proverb of _Nulla dies sine linea_. His most
perfect picture was Venus Anadyomene, which was not quite finished when
he died. He painted a picture in which a horse was a prominent feature,
and so correctly was it delineated that a horse passing by it neighed,
supposing it to be alive. He was ordered by Alexander to paint a
portrait of one of his favorites--Campaspe. Apelles became enamored with
her and married her. He only put his name to three of his pictures--a
sleeping Venus, Venus Anadyomene, and an Alexander. The proverb, _Ne
sutor ultra crepidam_, has been used in reference to him by some
writers.

=Aphrodi´te.= The Grecian name for Venus, from the Greek word [Greek:
aphros], _froth_, because Venus is said to have been born from the froth

her beauty gained her many admirers, and to free herself from their
importunities she proposed to run a race with them. As she was almost
invincible in running, her suitors, who entered the lists against her,
were defeated, till Hippomenes, the son of Macareus, proposed himself as
an admirer. Venus gave him three golden apples from the garden of the

immortal hatred to the royal family, and made the people swear they
would submit no longer to the kingly authority. His sons conspired to
restore the Tarquins, and were tried and condemned before their father,
who himself attended their execution. Mr. John Howard Payne, the
American dramatist, has written a tragedy, of which Brutus is the hero.

=Bru´tus, Mar´cus Ju´nius=, father of Cæsar's murderer, followed the party
of Marius, and was conquered by Pompey, by whose orders he was put to
death.

=Bru´tus, Mar´cus Ju´nius=, the destroyer of Cæsar, conspired with many of
the most illustrious citizens of Rome, against Cæsar, and stabbed him in
Pompey's Basilica. The tumult following the murder was great, but the
conspirators fled to the Capitol, and by proclaiming freedom and liberty
to the populace, for the time established tranquillity. Antony, however,
soon obtained the popular ear, and the murderers were obliged to leave
Rome. Brutus retired into Greece, where he gained many friends. He was
soon pursued by Antony, who was accompanied by the young Octavius. The
famous battle of Philippi followed, in which Brutus and his friend
Cassius, who commanded the left wing of the army, were totally defeated.

Jupiter had carried away. His search proving fruitless, he consulted the
oracle of Apollo, and was told to build a city where he saw a heifer
stop in the grass, and call the country around Boeotia. He found the
heifer, as indicated by the oracle. Requiring water, he sent his
companions to fetch some from a neighboring grove. The water was guarded
by a dragon, who devoured those who were sent for it, and Cadmus, tired
of waiting, went himself to the place. He attacked the dragon and killed
it, sowing its teeth in the ground, on which a number of armed men rose
out of the earth. Cadmus threw a stone amongst them, and they at once
began fighting, and all were killed except five, who assisted him in
building the city. Cadmus introduced the use of letters in Greece--the
alphabet, as introduced by him, consisting of sixteen letters.

=Cæ´sar.= A surname given to the Julian family in Rome. This name, after
it had been dignified in the person of Julius Cæsar and his successors,
was given to the apparent heir of the empire in the age of the Roman
emperors. The first twelve emperors were distinguished by the name of
Cæsar. They reigned in this order--Julius Cæsar, Augustus, Tiberius,
Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, and
Domitian. Suetonius has written an exhaustive history of the Cæsars. C.
Julius Cæsar, the first emperor of Rome, was son of L. Cæsar and
Aurelia, the daughter of Cotta. He was descended, according to some
accounts, from Julus, the son of Æneas. His eloquence procured him
friends at Rome, and the generous manner in which he lived equally
served to promote his interest. He was appointed for five years over the
Gauls. Here he enlarged the boundaries of the Roman empire by conquest,
and invaded Britain, which till then was unknown to the Romans. The
corrupt state of the Roman senate, and the ambition of Cæsar and Pompey,
caused a civil war. Neither of these celebrated Romans would endure a
superior, and the smallest matters were grounds enough for unsheathing
the sword. By the influence of Pompey a decree was passed to strip Cæsar
of his power. Antony, as tribune, opposed this, and went to Cæsar's camp
with the news. On this Cæsar crossed the Rubicon, which was the boundary
of his province. The passage of the Rubicon was a declaration of war,
and Cæsar entered Italy with his army. Upon this Pompey left Rome and
retired to Dyrrachium, and Cæsar shortly afterwards entered Rome. He
then went to Spain, where he conquered the partisans of Pompey, and on
his return to Rome was declared dictator, and soon afterwards consul.
The two hostile generals met in the plains of Pharsalia, and a great
battle ensued B.C. 48. Pompey was defeated and fled to Egypt, where he
was slain. At length Cæsar's glory came to an end. Enemies had sprung up
around him, and a conspiracy, consisting of many influential Romans, was
formed against him. Conspicuous among the conspirators was Brutus, his
most intimate friend, who, with others, assassinated him in the senate
house in the ides of March, B.C. 44, in the fifty-sixth year of his age.
He wrote his Commentaries on the Gallic wars when the battles were
fought. This work is admired for its elegance and purity of style. It
was after his conquest over Pharnaces, king of Pontus, that he made use
of the words, which have since become proverbial, _Veni, vidi, vici_,
illustrative of the activity of his operations. Shakspeare's tragedy of
Julius Cæsar, in the third act of which he is assassinated, uttering as
his last words, "_Et tu, Brute!_ Then fall Cæsar"--is devoted to the
conspiracy and its results, ending with defeat and death of Brutus and
Cassius at Philippi.

=Calig´ula=, a Roman emperor, was son of Germanicus by Agrippina. He was
proud, wanton, and cruel. He was pleased when disasters befell his
subjects, and often expressed a wish that the Romans had but one head,
that he might have the pleasure of striking it off. He had a favorite
horse made consul, and adorned it with the most valuable trappings and
ornaments. The tyrant was murdered A.D. 41, in his twenty-ninth year,
after a reign of three years and ten months.

=Calli´ope.= One of the Muses, daughter of Jupiter and Mnemosyne, who

Calydonian boar. Meleager killed the animal, and gave the head to
Atalanta, of whom he was enamored.

=Calyp´so.= One of the Oceanides, or one of the daughters of Atlas,

seven years' delay he was permitted to depart from the island where
Calypso reigned.

=Camby´ses=, king of Persia, was the son of Cyrus the Great. He conquered

he killed their god Apis and plundered their temples.

=Camill´us, L. Fu´rius.= A celebrated Roman, called a second Romulus from
the services he rendered his country. He was banished for distributing
the spoils he had obtained at Veii. During his exile Rome was besieged

the Christian era, or, according to some writers, 72 or 73 years before
the foundation of Rome. It had reached its highest glory in the days of
Hamilcar and Hannibal.

=Cassan´der=, son of Antipater, made himself master of Macedonia after his
father's death, where he reigned for eighteen years.

=Cassan´dra=, daughter of Priam and Hecuba, was passionately loved by
Apollo, who promised to grant her whatever she might require, and she
obtained from him the power of seeing into futurity. Some say she
received the gift of prophecy, with her brother Helenus, by being placed
when young one night in the temple of Apollo, where serpents were found
wreathed round their bodies and licking their ears, which gave them a
knowledge of futurity. She was allotted to Agamemnon in the division of
the spoils of Troy, and was slain by Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife.

=Cas´sius C.= A celebrated Roman who became famous by being first quæstor
to Crassus in his expedition against Parthia. He married Junia, the
sister of Brutus, and joined Brutus in the conspiracy formed to
assassinate Cæsar, after which he returned to Philippi with Brutus, and
commanded one wing of the army in the famous battle fought there. On the
defeat of his forces he ordered one of his freedmen to kill him, and he
perished by the sword which had inflicted a wound on Cæsar. He was
called by Brutus "the last of all the Romans."

considered to be the god and patron of boxing and wrestling. Castor
distinguished himself in the management of horses.

=Catili´na, L. Ser´gius=, a celebrated Roman, descended from a noble
family. When he had squandered his fortune he secretly meditated the
ruin of his country, and conspired with many Romans as dissolute as
himself to extirpate the senate, plunder the treasuries, and set Rome on
fire. This plot, known as the Catiline conspiracy, was unsuccessful.
The history of it is written by Sallust. Catiline was killed in battle
B.C. 63.

=Ca´to, Mar´cus=, was great-grandson of the censor Cato. The early virtues
that appeared in his childhood seemed to promise that he would become a
great man. He was austere in his morals and a strict follower of the
tenets of the Stoics. His fondness for candor was so great that his
veracity became proverbial. In the Catilinian conspiracy he supported
Cicero, and was the chief cause of the capital punishment which was
inflicted on some of the conspirators. He stabbed himself after reading
Plato's treatise on the immortality of the soul, B.C. 46, in the
fifty-ninth year of his age.

possessions he left Rome, crossed the Euphrates, and hastened to make
himself master of Parthia. He was met by Surena, the Parthian general,

53.

wild beasts, receiving the name of Cybele from the mountain where her
life had been preserved.

=Cyclo´pes.= A race of men of gigantic stature, supposed to be the sons of
Coelus and Terra. They had only one eye, which was in the center of
the forehead. According to Hesiod they were three in number, and named
Arges, Brontes, and Steropes.

=Cy´rus.= A king of Persia, son of Cambyses and Mandane, daughter of
Astyages, king of Media. Xenophon has written the life of Cyrus; and
delineates him as a brave and virtuous prince, and often puts in his
mouth many of the sayings of Socrates.

=Cy´rus= the younger was the son of Darius Nothus, and the brother of
Artaxerxes, the latter succeeding to the throne at the death of Nothus.
Cyrus was appointed to the command of Lydia and the sea-coasts, where he
fomented rebellion and levied troops under various pretenses. At length
he took the field with an army of 100,000 Barbarians and 13,000 Greeks

Cunaxa. The engagement ended fatally for Cyrus, who was killed 401 years

displeasure of Minos, who ordered him to be confined in the labyrinth.
Here he made himself wings with feathers and wax, and fitted them to his
body, adopting the same course with his son Icarus, who was the
companion of his confinement. They mounted into the air, but the heat of
the sun melted the wax on the wings of Icarus, and he fell into the
ocean, which after him has been called the Icarian Sea. The father
alighted safely at Cumæ, where he built a temple to Apollo.

=Dan´ae=, daughter of Acrisius, king of Argos, and Eurydice. Jupiter was
enamored with her, and they had a son, with whom Danae was exposed in a
boat on the sea by her father. The winds carried them to the island of
Seriphus, where she was saved by some fishermen, and carried to
Polydectes, king of the place, whose brother, named Dictys, educated the
child, who was called Perseus, and kindly treated the mother.

=Dana´ides.= The fifty daughters of Danaus, king of Argos, who married the
fifty sons of their uncle Ægyptus. Danaus had been told by the oracle

fulfilled their father's wishes except one, Hypermnestra, who spared her
husband Lynceus.

siege of twenty months. He died B.C. 485.

=Dari´us=, the second king of Persia of that name, ascended the throne of
Persia soon after the murder of Xerxes. He carried on many wars with
success, aided by his generals and his son Cyrus the younger. He died
B.C. 404, after a reign of nineteen years.

=Dari´us.= The third king of Persia of that name. He soon had to take the
field against Alexander, who invaded Persia. Darius met him with an
enormous army, which, however, was more remarkable for the luxuries
indulged in by its leaders than for military courage. A battle was
fought near the Granicus, in which the Persians were easily defeated,
and another conflict followed near Issus, equally fatal to the Persians.
Darius escaped and assembled another powerful army. The last and
decisive battle was fought at Arbela, Alexander being again victorious.
When the fight was over Darius was found in his chariot covered with
wounds and expiring, B.C. 331.

=Dejani´ra.= A daughter of OEneus, king of Ætolia. Her beauty procured

distinguished for his fondness of dissipation when in dissolute society,
and for military skill and valor in the battle-field. He died B.C. 286.

=Deme´trius.= Surnamed _Soter_, king of Syria. His father gave him as a
hostage to the Romans. After the death of his father, Seleucus
Philopator, Antiochus Epiphanes usurped the throne of Syria, and was
succeeded by his son Antiochus Eupator. Demetrius procured his liberty,
and established himself on the throne, causing Eupator to be put to
death.

=Deme´trius.= Son of Soter, whom he succeeded after he had driven from the
throne a usurper, Alexander Bala. Demetrius gave himself up to luxury,
and suffered his kingdom to be governed by his favorites, thus becoming
odious to his subjects. He was at last killed by the governor of Tyre,
where he had fled for protection.

=Deme´trius Phale´reus.= A disciple of Theophrastus, who gained such
influence over the Athenians by his eloquence and the purity of his
manners that he was elected decennial archon, B.C. 317. He embellished
the city, and rendered himself popular by his munificence, but his
enemies plotted against him, and he fled to the court of Ptolemy Lagus,
where he was received with kindness. He put an end to his life by
permitting an asp to bite him, B.C. 284. There were several others of
the name of Demetrius of minor note.

=Democ´ritus.= A celebrated philosopher of Abdera, one of the disciples of
Leucippus. He travelled over the greatest part of Europe, Asia, and
Africa, in quest of knowledge, and returned home in the greatest
poverty. He indulged in continual laughter at the follies of mankind for
distracting themselves with care and anxiety in the short term of their
lives. He told Darius, who was inconsolable for the loss of his wife,
that he would raise her from the dead if he could find three persons who
had gone through life without adversity, whose names he might engrave on
the queen's monument. He taught his disciples that the soul died with
the body. He died in his 109th year, B.C. 361. He has been termed "the
laughing philosopher."

=Demos´thenes.= A celebrated Athenian, was son of a rich blacksmith and
Cleobule. He became pupil of Plato, and applied himself to study the
orations of Isocrates. At the age of seventeen he gave early proof of
his eloquence and abilities in displaying them against his guardians,
from whom he obtained restitution of the greater part of his estate. To
correct the stammering of voice under which he labored he spoke with
pebbles in his mouth. In the battle of Cheronæa he evinced cowardice,
and saved his life by flight. He ended his life by taking poison, which
he always carried in a quill, in the sixtieth year of his age, B.C. 322.

=Deuca´lion.= A son of Prometheus, who married Pyrrha, the daughter of
Epimetheus. He reigned over part of Thessaly, and in his age the earth
was covered by a deluge of water, sent by Jupiter as a punishment for
the impiety of mankind. Deucalion constructed a ship, and by this means
saved himself and Pyrrha. The ship, after being tossed on the waves for
nine days, rested on Mount Parnassus. The deluge of Deucalion is
supposed to have occurred B.C. 1503.

=Dia´na.= The goddess of hunting. According to Cicero there were three of
the name--viz.: a daughter of Jupiter and Proserpine, a daughter of
Jupiter and Latona, and a daughter of Upis and Glauce. The second is the
most celebrated, and all mention of Diana by ancient writers refers to
her. To shun the society of men she devoted herself to hunting, and was
always accompanied by a number of young women, who, like herself,
abjured marriage. She is represented with a quiver, and attended by
dogs. The most famous of her temples was that at Ephesus, which was one
of the wonders of the world.

=Dicta´tor.= A magistrate at Rome, invested with regal authority.

=Di´do.= A daughter of Belus, king of Tyre, who married Sichæus or
Sicharbus, her uncle, who was priest of Hercules. Pygmalion killed
Sichæsus to obtain his immense riches, and Dido, disconsolate at the
loss of her husband, set sail with a number of Tyrians in quest of a
place in which to form a settlement. A storm drove her fleet on the
African coast, and she bought of the inhabitants as much land as could
be covered by a bull's hide cut into thongs. On this land she built a
citadel called Byrsa, which was the nucleus of a great city. Her
subjects wished her to marry again, but she refused, and erected a
funeral pile, on which she ascended and stabbed herself to death.

=Diocletia´nus, Cai´us Valer´ius Jo´vius.= A celebrated Roman emperor,
born of an obscure family in Dalmatia. He was first a common soldier,
and by merit gradually rose to the position of a general, and at length
he was invested with imperial power. He has been celebrated for his
military virtues, and though he was naturally unpolished by education,
yet he was the friend and patron of learning and genius. His cruelty,
however, against the followers of Christianity, has been severely
reprobated. After reigning twenty-one years in great prosperity, he
abdicated, A.D. 304, and died nine years afterwards, aged sixty-eight.

=Diodo´rus, Sic´ulus.= Celebrated as the author of a history of Egypt,
Persia, Syria, Media, Greece, Rome and Carthage. It was divided into
forty books, of which only fifteen are extant, with a few fragments.

=Dio´genes.= A celebrated cynic philosopher of Sinope, banished from his
country for coining false money. From Sinope he retired to Athens, where
he became the disciple of Antisthenes, who was at the head of the
Cynics. He dressed himself in the garment which distinguished the
Cynics, and walked about the streets with a tub on his head, which
served him as a house. His singularity, joined to his great contempt for
riches, gained him reputation, and Alexander the Great visited the
philosopher and asked him if there was anything in which he could oblige
him. "Get out of my sunshine," was the reply of the Cynic. Such
independence pleased the monarch, who, turning to his courtiers, said,
"Were I not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes." He was once sold as
a slave, and his magnanimity so pleased his master, that he made him
the preceptor of his children and the guardian of his estates. He died,
B.C. 324, in the ninety-sixth year of his age. The life of Diogenes does
not bear strict examination: whilst boasting of his poverty, he was so
arrogant that it has been observed that his virtues arose from pride and
vanity, not from wisdom or sound philosophy.

=Dio´genes Laer´tius.= An Epicurean philosopher, born in Cilicia. He wrote
the lives of the philosophers, in ten books. This work contains an
accurate account of the ancient philosophers, and is replete with
anecdotes respecting them. It is compiled, however, without any plan,
method, or precision, though neatness and conciseness are observable in
it.

=Diome´des=, a son of Tydeus and Deiphyle, was king of Ætolia, and one of
the bravest of the Grecian chiefs in the Trojan war. He often engaged

horses to be devoured.

=Di´on.= A Syracusan, son of Hipparina, famous for his power and
abilities. He was related to Dionysius the First, who constantly advised
with him, and at whose court he obtained great popularity. He was
assassinated 354 years before the Christian era by one of his familiar
friends. His death was greatly lamented by the Syracusans, who raised a
monument to his memory. When Dionysius the Second ascended the throne he
banished Dion, who collected some forces, and in three days made himself
master of Syracuse.

=Di´on Cas´sius.= A native of Nicæa in Bithynia, who was raised to some
of the greatest offices of state in the Roman empire. He is celebrated
as the writer of a history of Rome which occupied him twelve years in
composing.

=Dionys´ius= the Elder was son of Hermocrates. He signalized himself in
the wars which the Syracusans carried on against Carthage, and made
himself absolute at Syracuse. His tyranny rendered himself odious to his
subjects. He made a subterraneous cave in a rock in the form of a human
ear, which was called "the Ear of Dionysius." The sounds of this cave
were all directed to one common tympanum, which had a communication with
an adjoining room, where Dionysius spent part of his time in listening
to what was said by those whom he had imprisoned. He died in the
sixty-third year of his age, B.C. 368, after a reign of thirty-eight
years.

=Dionys´ius= the Younger was son of Dionysius the First and Doris. He
succeeded his father, and as soon as he ascended the throne he invited
Plato to his court and studied under him for some time. Plato advised
him to lay aside the supreme power, in which he was supported by Dion.
This highly incensed Dionysius, who banished Dion, who collected forces
in Greece, and in three days rendered himself master of Syracuse, and
expelled the tyrant, B.C. 357. He, however, recovered Syracuse ten years
afterward, but was soon compelled to retire again by the Corinthians
under Timoleon.

=Dionys´ius= of Halicarnassus. A historian who left his country and came
to reside in Rome that he might study all the authors who had written
Roman history. He was occupied during twenty-four years on his work on
Roman antiquities, which consisted of twenty books.

=Dir´ce.= A woman whom Lycus, king of Thebes, married after he had
divorced Antiope. Amphion and Zethus, sons of Antiope, for cruelties she
practiced on Antiope, tied Dirce to the tail of a wild bull, by which
she was dragged over rocks and precipices till the gods pitied her and
changed her into a fountain.

=Discor´dia.= A malevolent deity, daughter of Nox, and sister to Nemesis,
the Parcæ, and Death. She was driven from heaven by Jupiter because she
sowed dissensions amongst the gods. At the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis
she threw an apple amongst the gods, inscribed with the words, _Detur
pulchriori_, which was the primary cause of the ruin of Troy, and of
infinite misfortunes to the Greeks.

=Dolabel´la, P. Corn.= A Roman who married the daughter of Cicero. During
the civil wars he warmly espoused the cause of Julius Cæsar, whom he
accompanied at the famous battles of Pharsalia and Munda.

=Domitia´nus, Ti´tus Fla´vius=, son of Vespasian and Flavia Domitilla,
made himself emperer of Rome on the death of his brother Titus, whom,
according to some accounts, he destroyed by poison. The beginning of his
reign promised hopefully, but Domitian became cruel, and gave way to
vicious indulgences. In the latter part of his reign he became
suspicious and remorseful. He was assassinated A.D. 96, in the
forty-fifth year of his age.

=Dra´co.= A celebrated lawgiver of Athens, who made a code of laws, B.C.
623, which, on account of their severity, were said to be written in
letters of blood. Hence the term "Draconic," applied to any punishment
of exceptional severity.

=Dru´sus.= A son of Tiberius and Vipsania, who became famous for his
courage displayed in Illyricum and Pannonia.

=Dru´sus, M. Liv´ius.= A celebrated Roman, who renewed the proposals
bearing on the Agrarian laws, which had proved fatal to the Gracchi.

=Dru´sus, Ne´ro Clau´dius.= A son of Tiberius Nero and Livia. He

miraculous events. Before he was eight months old Juno sent two snakes

Mercury to Omphale, queen of Lydia, whom he married, and whom he
permitted to dress in his armor while he was sitting to spin with her
female servants. He delivered Dejanira from the Centaur Nessus, whom he
killed. The Centaur, as he expired, gave Dejanira a mystic tunic, which,
in a jealous paroxysm, she gave to Hercules to put on, which he had no
sooner done than he was seized with a desperate distemper which was

Cassius, and afterwards those of Antony. He was made king of Judæa by
the aid of Antony, and after the battle of Actium he was continued in
power by submission to and flattery of Augustus. He rendered himself
odious by his cruelty, and as he knew his death would be a cause for
rejoicing, he ordered a number of the most illustrious of his subjects

such an effect on him that he did not long survive it. He died, after
being four days without taking any aliment, in his ninety-ninth year,
about 338 years B.C. He was honored after death by the erection of a
brazen statue to his memory by Timotheus, one of his pupils, and

Colchis, fell in love with Jason. She was a powerful magician, and on
Jason having vowed eternal fidelity to her, she gave him charms to

disavowed, and in consequence of this the term "Apostate" is generally
affixed to his name. He died, A.D. 363, in his thirty-second year. His

offense by giving the golden apple, as an award to beauty, to Venus
instead of herself.

fed with the milk of the goat Amalthæa. While he was very young he made
war on the Titans, whom he conquered. The beginning of his reign in the

Lucan was exposed to much annoyance from Nero, and was induced to join

traditions, in the early part of his life he found a treasure, to which
he owed his greatness and opulence. He showed hospitality to Silenus, in
return for which Bacchus permitted him to choose whatever recompense he
pleased. He demanded of the god that whatever he touched might be turned
into gold. His wish was granted, but when the very food which he
attempted to eat became gold in his mouth he prayed Bacchus to revoke
the favor, and he was ordered to wash himself in the river Pactolus, the

in consequence of maintaining that Pan was superior to Apollo in singing
and playing the flute, he had his ears changed into those of an ass by
the god.

=Mi´lo.= A celebrated athlete of Crotona in Italy. He is said to have

married the daughter of Olorus, king of the Thracians. He was present at
the celebrated battle of Marathon, where the command was ceded to him,
owing to his superior abilities. He obtained the victory, but an olive
crown, which he demanded from his fellow-citizens as a reward for his
valor, was refused. Afterwards he was intrusted with a fleet of seventy
ships, with which to punish some islands which had revolted to the
Persians. At first he was successful, but afterwards fortune frowned on
him. He was accused of treason and condemned to death, but his sentence
was, owing to his great services, commuted. He died in prison of some
wounds he had received, which became incurable.

=Miner´va=, the goddess of wisdom, war, and all the liberal arts, sprang,
full-grown and armed, from the head of Jupiter, and was immediately
admitted to the assembly of the gods, and became one of the most
faithful counselors of her father. Her power in heaven was great: she
could hurl the thunders of Jupiter, prolong the life of men, and bestow
the gift of prophecy. She was known amongst the ancients by many names.
She was called Athena, Pallas, Parthenos, Tritonia (because she was
worshiped near the lake Tritonis) and Hippia (because she first taught
mankind how to manage the horse), Sais (because she was worshipped at
Sais), and some other names. She is usually represented with a helmet on
her head with a large plume on it, in one hand holding a spear, and in
the other a shield with the head of Medusa on it. Temples were erected
for her worship in different places, one of the most renowned of which
was the Parthenon at Athens. From this building a large collection of
ancient sculpture was brought to the British Museum by Lord Elgin more
than sixty years ago, which is known as the "Elgin Marbles."

clue of thread given to him by Ariadne, daughter of King Minos.

=Mithrida´tes First=, king of Pontus. He was tributary to the crown of
Persia: his attempts to make himself independent of that fealty proved
fruitless, being defeated in a battle which he had provoked, and having
to sue for peace.

=Mithrida´tes=, surnamed "Eupator" and "The Great," succeeded to the
throne of Pontus when eleven years of age. The beginning of his reign
was marked by ambition and cruelty. At an early age he inured himself to
hardships by devoting himself to manly exercises, and sleeping in the
open air on the bare earth. He was constantly engaged in warfare against
the Romans, and his contests with them are known as the Mithridatic
wars. His hatred of the Romans was so great that, to destroy their
power, he ordered all of them that were in his dominions to be
massacred, and in one night 150,000, according to Plutarch, or 80,000,
according to another authority, were slaughtered. This cruel act called
for revenge, and great armies were sent against him. After varied
fortunes Mithridates had to succumb to Pompey, and, worn out with
misfortune, attempted to poison himself, but unsuccessfully, as the
numerous antidotes to poison which in early life he had taken
strengthened his constitution to resist the effect. He then ordered one
of his soldiers to give him the fatal blow with a sword, which was done.
He died about sixty-three years before the Christian era, in his
seventy-second year. He is said to have been the most formidable
opponent the Romans ever had, and Cicero estimates him as the greatest
monarch that ever sat upon a throne. It is recorded of him that he
conquered twenty-four nations, whose different languages he knew and
spoke fluently. There were a number of persons of the same name, but of
inferior note.

Virgil. The word Naiad has become Anglicized, and is in frequent use,
especially by the poets.

=Narcis´sus=, a beautiful youth, son of Cephisus and the nymph Liriope,
was born at Thespis in Boeotia. He saw his image reflected in a

him, that he killed himself. His blood was changed into a flower which
still bears his name.

Jupiter and Pluto. He was devoured by his father as soon as he was born,
and restored to life again by a potion given to Saturn, by Metis, the
first wife of Jupiter. Neptune shared with his brothers the empire of
Saturn, and received as his portion the kingdom of the sea. He did not
think this equivalent to the empire of heaven and earth, which Jupiter
had claimed, therefore he conspired to dethrone him. The conspiracy was
discovered, and Jupiter condemned Neptune to build the walls of Troy.
He married Amphitrite, who thus broke a vow she had made of perpetual
celibacy.

different scenes of depravity that were to be found. He appeared on the
stage, sometimes representing the meanest characters. He resolved to
imitate the burning of Troy, and caused Rome to be set on fire in
different places, the flames being unextinguished for nine days, and he
enjoyed the terrible scene. During the conflagration he placed himself
on the top of a tower and sang, accompanying himself on a lyre, of the
destruction of Troy. Many conspiracies were formed against him, the most
dangerous of which he was saved from by the confession of a slave. He
killed himself A.D. 68, in the thirty-second year of his age, after a
reign of thirteen years and eight months. Wretch that he was, it is said
that he had some few to mourn for him, and Suetonius records that some

himself among the Grecian chieftains by eloquence, wisdom, and prudence.

Romulus the Romans fixed on him to be their new king. Numa at first
refused the offer of the crown, but at length was prevailed on to accept
it. He endeavored to inculcate into the minds of his subjects a
reverence for the deity, and he did all he could to heal their
dissensions. He encouraged the report of his visits to the nymph Egeria,
and made use of her name to give sanction to the laws which he had made.
He dedicated a temple to Janus, which, during his whole reign, remained

reign of forty-three years (B.C. 672), during which he had given
encouragement to the useful arts, and had cultivated peace.

advantage over the troops of Sapor, and took his wife prisoner, besides
gaining great booty. He died by the hand of one of his relations whom he
had offended. Zenobia succeeded him on the throne.

=OE´dipus.= A son of Laius, king of Thebes, and Jocasta. Laius was

domestic, with orders to expose him to death on the mountains, where he
was found by one of the shepherds of Polybus, king of Corinth.
Periboea, the wife of Polybus, educated him as her own child, tending
him with great care. In after life he met Laius in a narrow lane in a
chariot, and being haughtily ordered to make way for Laius, a combat
ensued in which Laius was slain. After this OEdipus was attracted to
Thebes by the fame of the Sphinx, who devoured all those who attempted
to explain without success the enigmas which she propounded. The enigma
proposed by the Sphinx to OEdipus was:--What animal in the morning
walks upon four feet, at noon upon two, and in the evening upon three?
OEdipus solved the riddle by replying that the animal was man, who in
childhood crawls on his hands and feet, on attaining manhood walks on
two feet erect, and in the evening of life supports his tottering steps
with a staff. The monster on hearing the correct solution of the riddle,
dashed her head against a rock and perished.

died on his way to Argolis.

=OEnom´aus.= King of Pisa, in Elis, and father of Hippodamia. He was
told by the oracle that he would perish by his son-in-law. Being
skillful in driving a chariot, he announced that he would give his
daughter in marriage only to some one who could defeat him in a race,
death being the result of those who were defeated. After a number of
aspirants had contended and failed, Pelops, son of Tantalus, entered the

are numerous, consisting of commentaries on the Scriptures and various
treatises.

=Or´pheus.= A son of OEger and the Muse Calliope. Some suppose him to be
the son of Apollo. He received a lyre from Apollo, or, according to
some, from Mercury, on which he played in such a masterly manner that
the melodious sounds caused rivers to cease to flow, and savage beasts
to forget their wildness. He married Eurydice, who died from the bite of
a serpent. Orpheus felt her death acutely, and to recover her he visited
the infernal regions. Pluto, the king of the infernal regions, was
enraptured with the strains of music from the lyre of Orpheus, and,
according to the poets, the wheel of Ixion stopped, the stone of
Sisyphus stood still, Tantalus forgot his burning thirst, and even the
Furies relented, so fascinating were the sounds extracted from the lyre.
Pluto was moved by the sorrow of Orpheus, and consented to restore
Eurydice to him, provided he forebore to look behind him till he had
reached the extremity of his domain. Orpheus agreed to this, but forgot
his promise, and turned round to look at Eurydice, who instantly
vanished from his sight. After this he separated himself from the
society of mankind, and the Thracian women, whom he had offended by his
coldness, attacked him whilst they celebrated the orgies of Bacchus, and
after they had torn his body to pieces they threw his head into the
Hebrus.

=Osi´ris.= A great deity of the Egyptians, husband of Isis. The ancients
differ in opinion concerning this celebrated god, but they all agree
that as ruler of Egypt he took care to civilize his subjects, to improve
their morals, to give them good and salutary laws, and to teach them
agriculture.

=Ovid´ius, P. Na´so.= A celebrated Roman poet born at Sulmo. He was sent
at an early age to Rome, and afterwards went to Athens in the sixteenth
year of his age, where his progress in the study of eloquence was great.
His natural inclination, however, was towards poetry, and to this he
devoted his chief attention. His lively genius and fertile imagination
soon gained him admirers; the learned became his friends; Virgil,
Propertius, Horace, and Tibullus, honored him with their correspondence,
and Augustus patronized him with unbounded liberality. These favors,
however, were transitory, and he was banished to a place on the Euxine
Sea by order of the emperor. The true cause of his banishment is not
known. His friends ardently entreated the emperor to permit him to
return, but in vain, and he died in the seventh or eighth year of his
banishment, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, A.D. 17. A great portion
of his works remains. These consist of the "Metamorphoses," "Fasti,"
"Epistolæ," etc. Whilst his works are occasionally disfigured by
indelicacy, they are distinguished by great sweetness and elegance.


=Pacto´lus.= A celebrated river of Lydia. It was in this river that Midas
washed himself when he turned into gold whatever he touched.

=Pæ´an.= A surname of Apollo, derived from the word _pæan_, a hymn which
was sung in his honor for killing the serpent Python.

=Palæ´mon= or =Pale´mon=. A sea deity, son of Athamas and Ino. His original
name was Melicerta. He assumed the name of Palæmon after being changed
into a sea deity by Neptune.

=Palame´des.= A Grecian chief, son of Nauplius, king of Euboea, and
Clymene. He was sent by the Greek princes, who were going to the Trojan
war, to bring Ulysses to the camp, who, to withdraw himself from the
expedition, had pretended to be insane. Palamedes soon penetrated the
deception, and Ulysses was obliged to join in the war, but an inveterate
enmity arose between the two, and by an unworthy artifice Ulysses
procured the death of Palamedes. Palamedes is accredited with the
invention of dice, backgammon, and other games.

=Palati´nus, Mons.= A celebrated hill, the largest of the seven hills on
which Rome was built.

=Palinu´rus.= A skillful pilot of the ship of Æneas. He fell into the sea
whilst asleep, and was exposed to the waves for three days, and on
reaching the shore was murdered by the inhabitants of the place where he
landed.

=Palla´dium.= A celebrated statue of Pallas. It represented the goddess as
holding a spear in her right hand, and in her left a distaff and
spindle. It fell down from heaven near the tent of Ilus as he was
building the citadel of Ilium, whilst, according to others, it fell in
Phrygia; another account says Dardanus received it as a present from his
mother Electra; other accounts are given of its origin. It is generally
agreed, however, that on the preservation of the statue the fate of Troy
depended. This was known to the Greeks during the Trojan war, and they
contrived to obtain possession of it. But some authors say that the true
Palladium was not carried away by the Greeks, but only a statue which
had been placed near it, and which bore some resemblance to it.

=Pal´las.= A name of Minerva. She is said to have received the name
because she killed a noted giant bearing that name.

=Palmy´ra.= The capital of Palmyrene, a country on the eastern boundaries
of Syria, now called Tadmor. It is famous as being the seat of
government of the celebrated Queen Zenobia.

=Pan.= The god of shepherds, huntsmen, and the inhabitants of the country.
He was in appearance a monster; he had two small horns on his head, and
his legs, thighs, tail, and feet were like those of the goat.

=Pan´darus.= A son of Lycaon, who aided the Trojans in their war with the
Greeks. He broke the truce which had been agreed on by the contending
armies, and wounded Menelaus and Diomedes. He was at last killed by
Diomedes.

=Pandi´on.= A king of Athens, father of Procne and Philomela. During his
reign there was such an abundance of corn, wine, and oil in his realm,
that it was supposed that Bacchus and Minerva had personally visited the
country.

=Pando´ra.= A celebrated woman; the first mortal female that ever lived,
according to Hesiod. She was made of clay by Vulcan, and having received
life, all the gods made presents to her. Venus gave her beauty and the
art of pleasing; the Graces gave her the power of captivating; Apollo
taught her how to sing, and Mercury instructed her in eloquence. Jupiter
gave her a beautiful box, which she was ordered to present to the man
who married her. This was Epithemeus, brother of Prometheus, who opened
the box, from which issued a multitude of evils, which became dispersed
all over the world, and which from that fatal moment have never ceased
to affect the human race. Hope alone remained at the bottom of the box.

=Pan´sa, C. Vib´ius.= A Roman consul, who, with Hirtius, pursued the
assassins of Cæsar, and was killed in a battle near Mutina.

=Pan´theon.= A celebrated temple at Rome, built by Agrippa in the reign of
Augustus, and dedicated to all the gods.

=Par´cæ.= The Fates, powerful goddesses who presided over the birth and
life of mankind. They were three in number, Clotho, Lachesis, and
Atropos, daughters of Nox and Erebus, according to Hesiod, or, according
to what he says in another place, of Jupiter and Themis.

=Par´is.= The son of Priam, king of Troy, and Hecuba; he was also called
Alexander. He was destined before his birth to cause the ruin of his
country, and before he was born his mother dreamt that he would be a
torch which would set fire to her palace. The soothsayers predicted that
he would be the cause of the destruction of Troy. In consequence of
these foretold calamities Priam ordered a slave to destroy the child
immediately after birth, but instead of acting thus the slave exposed
the child on Mount Ida, where some shepherds found him and took care of
him. Paris gave early proofs of courage, and his graceful countenance
recommended him to OEnone, a nymph of Ida, whom he married. At the
marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the goddess of discord, who had not been
invited, showed her displeasure by throwing into the assembly of the
gods, who were at the nuptials, a golden apple, on which were the words:
Let it be given to the fairest. The apple was claimed by Juno, Venus,
and Minerva. Paris, who had been appointed to award it to the most
beautiful of the three goddesses, gave it to Venus. Subsequently Paris
visited Sparta, where he persuaded Helen, wife of Menelaus, the most
beautiful woman of the age, to elope with him. This caused the Trojan
war. Different accounts are given of the death of Paris. By some he is
said to have been killed by one of the arrows of Philoctetes which had
once belonged to Hercules.

=Parme´nio.= A celebrated general in the armies of Alexander the Great, by
whom he was regarded with the greatest affection. The firm friendship
which existed between the two generals was broken in a sudden fit of
anger by Alexander, who ordered his friend to be put to death, B.C. 330.

=Parnas´sus.= A mountain of Phocis sacred to the Muses, and to Apollo and
Bacchus. It was named thus after a son of Neptune who bore that
designation.

=Parrha´sius.= A famous painter of Ephesus in the age of Zeuxis, about
fifteen years before Christ. He contended, on one occasion, with Zeuxis
for the palm in painting, and Zeuxis acknowledged that he was excelled
by Parrhasius.

=Par´thenon.= A temple of Athens sacred to Minerva. It was destroyed by
the Persians, and was rebuilt by Pericles.

=Pasiph´ae.= A daughter of the Sun and of Perseis, who married Minos, king
of Crete. She became the mother of the Minotaur, which was killed by
Theseus.

=Patro´clus.= One of the Grecian chiefs during the Trojan war. He
contracted an intimate friendship with Achilles, and when the Greeks
went to the Trojan war Patroclus accompanied them. He was the constant
companion of Achilles, living in the same tent, and when his friend
refused to appear in the field of battle, because of being offended with
Agamemnon, Patroclus imitated his example. Nestor, however, prevailed on
him again to take the field, and Achilles lent him his armor. Hector
encountered him, and after a desperate fight slew him. The Greeks
obtained his dead body, which was brought into the Grecian camp, where
Achilles received it with great lamentation, and again taking the field,
killed Hector, thus avenging the death of his friend.

=Pau´lus Æmil´ius.= A Roman celebrated for his military achievements,
surnamed "Macedonicus" from his conquest of Macedonia. In early life he
distinguished himself by his application and for his love for military
discipline. In his first consulship he reduced the Ligurians to
subjection, and subsequently obtained a great victory over the
Macedonians, making himself master of the country. In the office of
censor, which he filled, he behaved with great moderation, and at his
death, about 168 years before the Christian era, the Romans mourned
deeply for him.

=Pausa´nias.= A Spartan general who greatly signalized himself at the
battle of Platæa against the Persians. He afterwards, at the head of the
Spartan armies, extended his conquests in Asia, but the haughtiness of
his behavior made him many enemies. He offered, on certain conditions,
to betray Greece to the Persians, but his perfidy was discovered, on
which he fled for safety to a temple of Minerva, where he was starved to
death, B.C. 471.

=Peg´asus.= A winged horse sprung from the blood of Medusa. According to
Ovid he fixed his abode on Mount Helicon, where, by striking the earth
with his foot, he raised a fountain which has been called Hippocrene.

=Pe´leus.= A king of Thessaly, son of Æacus and Endeis, the daughter of
Chiron. He married Thetis, one of the Nereids.

=Pe´lias.= Son of Neptune and Tyro. On his birth he was exposed in the
woods, but his life was preserved by some shepherds. Subsequently Tyro
was married to Cretheus, king of Iolchos. They had three children, of
whom Æson was the eldest. Pelias visited his mother after the death of
Cretheus, and usurped the authority which properly belonged to the
children of the deceased monarch. Jason, the son of Æson, who had been
educated by Chiron, on attaining manhood demanded the kingdom, the
government of which Pelias had usurped. Jason was persuaded by Pelias to
waive his claim for the present, and start on the Argonautic
expedition. On his return, accompanied by the sorceress Medea, she
undertook to restore Pelias to youth, explaining that it was necessary
first to cut his body to pieces and place the limbs in a caldron of
boiling water. This was done, when Medea refused to fulfill her promise,
which she had solemnly made to the daughters of Pelias, who were four in
number, and who had received the patronymic of the "Peliades."

=Pe´lion=, sometimes called Pelios. A celebrated mountain of Thessaly, the
top of which is covered with pine-trees.

=Pelop´idas.= A celebrated general of Thebes, son of Hippoclus. It was
owing to his valor and prudence, combined with the ability of
Epaminondas, that the famous victory of Leuctra was won.

=Pe´lops.= A celebrated prince, son of Tantalus, king of Phrygia. He was
killed by his father, and served up as a feast to the gods, who had
visited Phrygia. He was restored to life, and married Hippodamia, having
won her through defeating her father in a chariot race.

=Pena´tes.= Certain inferior deities among the Romans, who presided over
the domestic affairs of families.

=Penel´ope.= A celebrated princess of Greece, daughter of Icarius, and
wife of Ulysses, king of Ithaca. She became the mother of Telemachus,
and was obliged to part, with great reluctance, from her husband, when
the Greeks obliged him to go to the Trojan war. The strife between the
hostile forces continued for ten years, and when Ulysses did not return
home at the conclusion of the war her fears and anxieties became
overwhelming. She was beset by a number of suitors, who told her that
her husband would never return, and she ought to give herself to one of
her admirers. She received their advances with coldness, but as she was
devoid of power, and, as it were, almost a prisoner in their hands, she
temporized with them. After twenty years' absence Ulysses returned, and
at once delivered her from the persecutions of her suitors. Penelope is
described by Homer as a model of female propriety, whilst some more
modern writers dispute the correctness of this view. The accounts given
by different authors respecting her, in fact, differ materially. By some
she is said to have been the mother of Pan.

=Penthesile´a.= A queen of the Amazons, daughter of Mars. She came to
assist Priam in the last years of the Trojan war, and was slain by
Achilles.

=Per´gamus.= The citadel of the city of Troy. The word is often used to
signify Troy. From it Xerxes reviewed his troops as he marched to invade
Greece.

=Per´icles.= An Athenian of noble family, son of Xanthippus and Agariste.
His naturally great mental powers were greatly improved by attending the
lectures of Zeno and other philosophers. He became a commander, a
statesman, and an orator, and gained the esteem of the people by his
address and liberality. In his ministerial capacity, Pericles did not
enrich himself. The prosperity and happiness of Athens was his primary
object. He made war against the Lacedæmonians, and restored the temple
of Delphi to the care of the Phocians, who had been improperly deprived
of that honorable trust. The Peloponnesian war was fomented by his
ambitious views. He at length lost his popularity, but only temporarily,
and he was restored to all the honors of which he had been deprived. A
pestilence which prevailed proved fatal to him in his seventieth year,
about 429 years before Christ.

=Per´seus.= A son of Jupiter and Danae, the daughter of Acrisius. It had
been predicted by the oracle that Acrisius was to perish by his
daughter's offspring, so Perseus, soon after his birth, was, with his
mother Danae, thrown into the sea. Both were saved and reached the
island of Seriphos, where they were treated kindly by Polydectes, the
king, who, however, soon became jealous of the genius of Perseus.
Perseus had promised Polydectes to bring him the head of the Gorgon
Medusa. To enable him to obtain this Pluto lent him a helmet which made
the wearer invisible. Minerva gave him her buckler, and Mercury
furnished him with wings. Thus equipped he found the Gorgons, and cut
off Medusa's head, with which he fled through the air, and from the
blood which dropped from it, sprang the horse Pegasus. During his flight
Perseus discovered Andromeda chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea
monster, which he destroyed, and married Andromeda. He now returned to
Seriphos, where he turned into stone Polydectes by showing him Medusa's
head. By an accident, in throwing a quoit he killed Acrisius, thus
fulfilling the prediction of the oracle.

=Per´seus= or =Per´ses=. A son of Philip, king of Macedonia. He
distinguished himself by his enmity to the Romans, and when he had made
sufficient preparations he declared war against them. He, however,
wanted courage and resolution, and though he at first obtained some
advantages over the Roman armies, his timidity proved destructive to his
cause. He was defeated at Pydna, and soon after was taken prisoner, and
died in prison at Rome.

=Per´sius, Au´lus Flac´cus.= A Latin poet of Volaterræ. He was of a good
family, and soon became intimate with the most illustrious Romans of his
day. The early part of his life was spent in his native town, but at
the age of sixteen he was removed to Rome, where he studied philosophy.
He died in his thirtieth year, A.D. 62. The satires of Persius were read
with pleasure and avidity by his contemporaries.

=Per´tinax, Pub´lius Hel´vius.= A Roman emperor after the death of
Commodus. He was descended from an obscure family, and for some time was
employed in drying wood and making charcoal. He entered on a military
life and by his valor rose to offices of the highest trust, and was made
consul. At the death of Commodus he was selected to succeed to the
throne. His patriotism gained him the affection of the worthiest of his
subjects, but there were some who plotted against him. He was killed by
his soldiers, A.D. 193.

=Petro´nius Ar´biter.= A favorite of the emperor Nero, and one of the
ministers and associates of his pleasures and vices. He was made
proconsul of Bithynia, and afterwards was honored with the consulship.
Eventually he became out of favor with Nero, and resolved to destroy
himself, which he did by having his veins opened, A.D. 66. Petronius
distinguished himself by his writings as well as by his voluptuousness.
He is the author of many elegant compositions, which are, however, often
characterized by impropriety of language.

=Phæ´dra.= A daughter of Minos and Pasiphæ, who married Theseus. She
became the mother of Acamas and Demophoon. She brought an unjust
accusation against Hippolytus (a son of Theseus before she married him),
who was killed by the horses in his chariot taking fright, causing him
to be thrown under the wheels and crushed to death. On hearing this
Phædra acknowledged the falseness of the charge she had brought against
Hippolytus, and hanged herself in despair.

=Phæ´drus.= A Thracian who became one of the freed men of the emperor
Augustus. He translated the fables of Æsop into Iambic verse.

=Pha´ethon.= A son of the Sun, or of Phoebus and Clymene. According to
Hesiod and Pausanias he was son of Cephalus and Aurora, or of Tithonus
and Aurora, according to Apollodorus. He is, however, generally
acknowledged to be son of Phoebus and Clymene. Phoebus allowed him
to drive the chariot of the sun for one day. Phaethon, on receiving the
reins, at once showed his incapacity; the horses became unmanageable,
and heaven and earth were threatened with a conflagration, when Jupiter
struck Phaethon with a thunderbolt, and hurled him into the river Po,
where he perished.

=Phal´aris.= A tyrant of Agrigentum, who treated his subjects with great
cruelty. Perillus made him a brazen bull, inside of which he proposed to
place culprits, and by applying fire burn them to death. The first to be
thus burnt in this manner was Perillus himself. The cruelties practiced
by Phalaris were revenged by a revolt of his people, who put him to
death by burning him in the bull.

=Pha´on.= A boatman of Mitylene, in Lesbos. He received a box of ointment
from Venus, who had presented herself to him in the form of an old
woman. When he had rubbed himself with the unguent he became beautiful,
and Sappho, the celebrated poetess, became enamored with him. For a
short time he devoted himself to her, but soon treated her with
coldness, upon which she threw herself into the sea and was drowned.

=Pharnaba´zus.= A satrap of Persia who assisted the Lacedæmonians against
the Athenians, and gained their esteem by his devotion to their cause.

=Pha´ros.= A small island in the bay of Alexandria, on which was built a
tower which was considered one of the seven wonders of the world. It was
erected in the reigns of Ptolemy Soter and Ptolemy Philadelphus, the
architect being Sostratus, the son of Dexiphanes.

=Pharsa´lia.= A town of Thessaly, famous for the great battle fought there
between Julius Cæsar and Pompey, in which the former obtained the
victory.

=Phid´ias.= A celebrated sculptor of Athens, who died B.C. 432. He
executed a statue of Minerva, which was placed in the Pantheon.

=Philip´pi.= A town of Macedonia, celebrated for two battles fought there,
B.C. 42, between Augustus and Antony and the republican forces of Brutus
and Cassius, in which the former were victorious.

=Philip´pus=, king of Macedonia, was son of Amyntas, king of Macedonia. He
learnt the art of war from Epaminondas. He married Olympias, the
daughter of Neoptolemus, king of the Molossi, and became father of
Alexander the Great. Amongst the most important events of his reign was
the battle of Chæronea, which he won from the Greeks. The character of
Philip is that of a sagacious, prudent, but artful and intriguing,
monarch. He was assassinated by Pausanias at the celebration of the
nuptials of his daughter, in the forty-seventh year of his age and the
twenty-fourth of his reign, about 336 years before the Christian era.

=Philip´pus.= The last king of Macedonia of that name was son of
Demetrius. He aspired to become the friend of Hannibal. His intrigues
were discovered by the Romans, who invaded his territories, and
extorted peace from him on terms which were humiliating. He died in the
forty-second year of his reign, 179 years before the Christian era.

=Phi´lo.= A Jewish writer of Alexandria, A.D. 40. His works related to the
creation of the world, sacred history, and the laws and customs of the
Jewish nation.

=Philocte´tes= was one of the Argonauts. He received from Hercules the
arrows which had been dipped in the gall of the Hydra. The Greeks, in
the tenth year of the Trojan war, were informed by the oracle that Troy
could not be taken without these arrows. Philoctetes repaired to the
Grecian camp, where he destroyed a number of the Trojans, among whom was
Paris, with the arrows. The adventures of Philoctetes are the subject of
one of the best tragedies of Sophocles.

=Philome´la.= A daughter of Pandion, king of Athens. Her sister Procne had
married Tereus, king of Thrace, and being separated from Philomela spent
her time in great melancholy. She persuaded her husband to go to Athens
and bring her sister to Thrace. Tereus, on the journey, treated
Philomela with great cruelty, and cut off her tongue, confining her in a
lonely castle, and reporting to Procne that she was dead. Philomela,
however, found means to inform Procne that she was living. In revenge
for the cruelty of Tereus, Procne murdered his son and served him up as
food at a banquet. On hearing this Tereus drew his sword to slay the
sisters, when he was changed into a hoopoe, Philomela into a
nightingale, and Procne into a swallow.

=Philopoe´men.= A celebrated general of the Achæans, born at Megalopolis.
At an early age he distinguished himself in the field of battle, at the
same time appearing fond of agriculture and a country life. He adopted
Epaminondas as his model, and was not unsuccessful in imitating the
prudence and other good qualities of the famous Theban. When Megalopolis
was attacked by the Spartans, Philopoemen, then in his thirtieth year,
gave the most decisive proofs of his valor. Raised to the rank of
commander, he showed his ability to discharge that important trust, by
killing with his own hand Mechanidas, the tyrant of Sparta, and
defeating his army. Sparta having become, after its conquest, tributary
to the Achæans, Philopoemen enjoyed the triumph of having subdued one of
the most powerful states of Greece. He was at length made prisoner by
the Messenians, and was treated by their general, Dinocrates, with great
severity. He was poisoned in his seventieth year, about 183 years before
the Christian era.

=Philos´tratus.= A famous Sophist, born at Lemnos, or, according to some,
at Athens. He came to Rome, where he was patronized by Julia, the wife
of the emperor Severus. She intrusted him with some papers referring to
Apollonius, whose life he wrote. This biography is written with
elegance, but contains many exaggerated descriptions and improbable
stories.

=Phi´neus.= A son of Agenor, king of Phoenicia, or, according to some, a
son of Neptune, who became king of Thrace. He married Cleopatra (called
by some Cleobula), the daughter of Boreas, their children being
Plexippus and Pandion. After the death of Cleopatra, he married Idæa,
the daughter of Dardanus, who, jealous of Cleopatra's children, accused
them of an attempt on their father's life, and they were condemned by
Phineus to have their eyes put out. This cruelty was punished by the
gods, Phineus being made blind, and the Harpies were sent by Jupiter to
keep him in continual alarm. He recovered his sight by means of the
Argonauts, whom he received with great hospitality.

=Phleg´ethon.= A river in the infernal regions, between the banks of which
flames of fire flowed instead of water.

=Phle´gon.= One of the emperor Adrian's freedmen. He wrote a historical
account of Sicily, an account of the principal places in Rome, and
treatises on different subjects. His style was inelegant, and he evinced
a want of judgment in his writings.

=Pho´cion.= An Athenian celebrated for his public and private virtues. He
was distinguished for his zeal for the general good, and for his
military abilities. The fickleness of the Athenians, however, caused
them to lose sight of his virtues, and being accused of treason, he was
condemned to drink poison, which he took with the greatest heroism. His
death occurred about 318 years before the Christian era.

=Phoe´nix=, son of Amyntor, king of Argos, and Cleobule or Hippodamia,
was preceptor to Achilles. He accompanied his pupil to the Trojan war,
and Achilles was ever grateful for the precepts he had received from
him. After the fall of Troy he died in Thrace, and, according to Strabo,
was buried near Trachinia, where his name was given to a river.

=Phry´ne.= A beautiful woman who lived at Athens about 328 years before
the Christian era. She was beloved by Praxiteles, who painted her
portrait. It is said that Apelles painted his Venus Anadyomene after he
had seen Phryne on the sea-shore with disheveled hair. There was another
woman of the same name, who was accused of impiety. When her judges were
about to condemn her she unveiled her bosom, and her beauty so
captivated them that they acquitted her.

=Phryx´us.= A son of Athamas, king of Thebes, and Nephele. On the plea of
insanity, Nephele was repudiated by Athamas, who then married Ino, who
persecuted Phryxus with inveterate hatred, because he was to succeed to
the throne in preference to one of her own children. Being apprised that
Ino had designs on his life, he started with his sister Helle to go to
Ætes, king of Colchis. According to the poets they mounted on a ram,
whose fleece was gold, which soared into the air, directing its course
to Colchis. Helle became giddy, and falling into the sea (afterwards
called the Hellespont), was drowned. Phryxus arrived at the court of
Ætes, whose daughter Chalciope he married. Sometime afterwards he was
killed by his father-in-law. The murder of Phryxus gave rise to the
famous Argonautic expedition under Jason, the object being to recover
the Golden Fleece, which Jason succeeded in obtaining.

=Phyl´lis.= A daughter of Sithon, or, according to other writers, of
Lycurgus, king of Thrace. She received Demophoon, who landed on her
coasts on his return from the Trojan war, and fell in love with him, and
he reciprocated her affection; but afterwards proving faithless, Phyllis
hanged herself, and according to an old tradition, was changed into an
almond tree.

=Pi´cus.= King of Latium, son of Saturn, who married Venilia. As he was
hunting he was met by Circe, who became enamored with him. She changed
him into a woodpecker.

=Pier´ides.= A name given to the Muses, because they were born in Pieria,
or, as some say, because they were supposed to be the daughters of
Pierus, a king of Macedonia, who settled in Boeotia.

=Pin´darus.= A celebrated lyric poet of Thebes. When he was young it is
said that a swarm of bees settled on his lips and left on them some
honey, which was regarded as a prognostic of his future greatness. After
his death great respect was shown to his memory, and a statue was

Xenophon became conspicuous. He had to direct an army of ten thousand
Greeks, who were now more than six hundred leagues from home, and in a
country surrounded by an active enemy. He rose superior to all
difficulties till the celebrated "Retreat of the Ten Thousand" was
effected; the Greeks returning home after a march of two hundred and
fifteen days. Xenophon employed his pen in describing the expedition of

abilities.

=Zeux´is.= A celebrated painter born at Heraclea. He flourished 468 years

emblem of a Supreme Being. He was respected by his subjects and

had many disciples. The religion of the Parsees of the present day was
founded by Zoroaster.

Christian era. He wrote a history of some of the Roman emperors, which

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

"Mrs. Holmes' stories are universally read. Her admirers are numberless.
She is in many respects without a rival in the world of fiction. Her
characters are always life-like, and she makes them talk and act like
human beings, subject to the same emotions, swayed by the same passions,
and actuated by the same motives which are common among men and women of
every day existence. Mrs. Holmes is very happy in portraying domestic
life. Old and young peruse her stories with great delight, for she
writes in a style that all can comprehend."--_New York Weekly._

=The North American Review=, vol. 81, page 557, says of Mrs. Mary J.
Holmes' novel, "English Orphans":--"With this novel of Mrs. Holmes' we
have been charmed, and so have a pretty numerous circle of
discriminating readers to whom we have lent it. The characterization is
exquisite, especially so far as concerns rural and village life, of
which there are some pictures that deserve to be hung up in perpetual
memory of types of humanity fast becoming extinct. The dialogues are
generally brief, pointed, and appropriate. The plot seems simple, so
easily and naturally is it developed and consummated. Moreover, the
story thus gracefully constructed and written, inculcates without
obtruding, not only pure Christian morality in general, but, with
especial point and power, the dependence of true success on character,
and of true respectability on merit."

"Mrs. Holmes' stories are all of a domestic character, and their
interest, therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly
seasoned with sensationalism, but it is of a healthy and abiding
character. Almost any new book which her publisher might choose to
announce from her pen would get an immediate and general reading. The
interest in her tales begins at once, and is maintained to the close.
Her sentiments are so sound, her sympathies so warm and ready, and her
knowledge of manners, character, and the varied incidents of ordinary
life is so thorough, that she would find it difficult to write any other
than an excellent tale if she were to try it."--_Boston Banner._

                        CHARLES DICKENS' WORKS.

                             A NEW EDITION.


Among the many editions of the works of this greatest of English
Novelists, there has not been until _now_ one that entirely satisfies
the public demand.--Without exception, they each have some strong
distinctive objection,--either the form and dimensions of the volumes
are unhandy--or, the type is small and indistinct--or, the illustrations
are unsatisfactory--or, the binding is poor--or, the price is too high.

An entirely new edition is _now_, however, published by G. W. Carleton &
Co., of New York, which, in every respect, completely satisfies the
popular demand.--It is known as

"=Carleton's New Illustrated Edition.="

COMPLETE IN 15 VOLUMES.

The size and form is most convenient for holding,--the type is entirely
new, and of a clear and open character that has received the approval of
the reading community in other works.

The illustrations are by the original artists chosen by Charles Dickens
himself--and the paper, printing, and binding are of an attractive and
substantial character.

This beautiful new edition is complete in 15 volumes--at the extremely
reasonable price of $1.50 per volume, as follows:--

  1.--PICKWICK PAPERS AND CATALOGUE.
  2.--OLIVER TWIST.--UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER.
  3.--DAVID COPPERFIELD.
  4.--GREAT EXPECTATIONS.--ITALY AND AMERICA.
  5.--DOMBEY AND SON.
  6.--BARNABY RUDGE AND EDWIN DROOD.
  7.--NICHOLAS NICKLEBY.
  8.--CURIOSITY SHOP AND MISCELLANEOUS.
  9.--BLEAK HOUSE.
  10.--LITTLE DORRIT.
  11.--MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT.
  12.--OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.
  13.--CHRISTMAS BOOKS.--TALE OF TWO CITIES.
  14.--SKETCHES BY BOZ AND HARD TIMES.
  15.--CHILD'S ENGLAND AND MISCELLANEOUS.

The first volume--Pickwick Papers--contains an alphabetical catalogue of
all of Charles Dickens' writings, with their exact positions in the
volumes.

This edition is sold by Booksellers, everywhere--and single specimen
copies will be forwarded by mail, _postage free_, on receipt of price,
